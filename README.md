# Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting **fake news articles** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. The system classifies news as **Real** or **Fake** based on textual content, helping reduce misinformation spread.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using **TF-IDF**, training multiple ML models, performance evaluation, and result visualization.
